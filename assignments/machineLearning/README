To import plugins and projects: 

1. Follow the instructions on the plugin site to create a build.sbt file with the resolvers, dependencies, etc
2. Type "sbt eclipse" 
3. Import project into Eclipse as "import existing project" 
4. If necessary, shut down Eclipse and start again, because Scala IDE is crazy and won't recognize plugins that are already there.
